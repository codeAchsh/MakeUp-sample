-About this Portfolio
In order to deepen my understanding of the parts I did not understand, I skipped the design process and used Figma to create a copy of the Prototype based on the sample images and proceeded with the coding.
I chose the simplest design possible. I decided not to code the screen transitions this time, but to follow the design closely in order to understand how HTML works.

*If you like it, please send me a work order.
